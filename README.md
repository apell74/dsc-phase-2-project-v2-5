# Overview
This project will use regression analysis to analyze home prices in King County, Washington based on key attributes.

Iterative linear regression analysis of multiple attributes create a clearer picture of the factors that add value to (or detract value from) a home. My firm, Pell & Associates Realty, can use the information from this analysis to deliver effective and accurate insights to prospective home buyers and sellers.

# Business Problem
While buying or selling a home is a tremendously important transaction for many Americans, the process of finding the right price can be quite opaque, with large fluctuations in home values being attributed simply to market factors or location. At Pell & Associates Realty, our goal is to demystify King County housing prices through statistical analysis.

This project will examine comprehensive data from over 30,000 homes, discovering trends and building predictive models to forecast what your home will be worth when it's time for a move!

# Data Understanding
The available data comes from a record of home sales in King County. The records span from 1900 to 2022. In this analysis, I selected several key features to predict a home's price. They include:

- Livable square footage
- No. of bedrooms
- No. of bathrooms
- Year built
- View
- Condition (relating to overall maintenance)
- Grade (relating to construction and design quality)
